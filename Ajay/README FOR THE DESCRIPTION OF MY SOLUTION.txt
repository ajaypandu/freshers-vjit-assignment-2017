THE COMPLETE DISCRIPTION OF THE SOLUTION

THE PROCESS:

Firstly,When the customer gets into the restaurant ,he would wish to go to his preferred cuisine section(Indian\Chinese\Italian\Malaysian\MultiCuisine) and sits in any of the tables and a menu card listing all the items and their costs would be given to him/her.Then the manager comes to the table where the customer resides and takes the order.

The code which I developed is executed in the electronic device carried by the manager.Firstly the manager gets logged in with the required credentials and a JFrame stating "HaveIt" and "TakeAway" appears.The Moment the manager clicks on any one of the options ,another frame stating "Choose a Cuisine" would appear where the manager has the access to choose the Cuisine where the customer resided."Go Back" option is also present where manager can move to the previous tabs too.Once a Cuisine is selected,a frame appears which has the table number buttons and the name of the executive chef,the manager clicks on a table button seeing the table number of the table which the customer chooses to sit.In the frame the table buttons are of varied sizes which tell us about the size of the table (i.e.two seater,three seater etc) and once a table is selected all the item names present in Starters ,MainCourse and deserts would appear,this application window also consists of the server's name who is the incharge to that table and a linecook assigned to that table(except for multicuisine).The Manager can now select the item names ,which are told by the customer and makes an order.Reset facility is also available in the window.The Server serves the food once it is done.After that,the window has a button under Bill and once that is clicked the total price including the taxes would appear.The Manager then shows the bill amount to the customer and the customer pays the bill.At the end ,the Customer would be asked to give his feedback on his experience in the Restaurant.When the submit button is clicked,it gets submitted and an acknowledgement frame will open and then click Ok which will redirect to the second tab i.e "Choose a Cuisine".This process goes on.
