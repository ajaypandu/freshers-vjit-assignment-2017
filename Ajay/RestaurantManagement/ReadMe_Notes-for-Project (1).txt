My idea goes like this:

I named the restaurant as "Rubicon red chillies" and we get every cuisine here.Firtly when the customer enters the restaurant ,he/she would be asked for the kind of  cuisine they prefer (like indian,chinese,italian etc),depending on their choice they would be directed to that particular section.Every section is again divided into sub-sections i.e. Veg or Non-Veg.Every table is assigned with a separate waiter and the cleaning boys,who takes the orders from the customer of that particular table.The billing details are done automatically when the items are selected.And the feedback forms would be given to the customers at the end.

My further thoughts are:

I would like to introduce a plan wherein the customer gets a chance to tell his maximum budget which he thinks of spending in the hotel and then the waiter would show all the items which can be bought with that budget.
At the end of a day (i.e. when hotel gets shut down),the hotel staff gets a estimate of how much food was wasted on that day and this estimate would be displayed with a message orientated quote in the hotel next day,so that customers would hesistate to waste food again.
Advanced booking of seat is made available to the customers
The waiter gets to know the information of the customers who are waiting outside the hotel ,so that negotiation will be easy.

THIS WAS MY INITIAL THOUGHT AND IS SUBJECTED TO FURTHER CHANGES.
